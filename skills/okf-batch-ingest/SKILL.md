# OKF Folder Ingest — Batch Markdown + Attachments

## Taxonomy reference (do not paste tables here)
- Shared map: `_config/taxonomy.md` (`@tax`)
- **FBC mandatory:** read FULL source body to choose domain/subdomain/subsubdomain and semantic tags.
- Map is extensible — if content does not fit, extend `@tax` + hubs (see extension protocol there).
- Tag *cleanup* (banned noise tags, singular/lowercase) is in `@tax`; do not keyword-assign tags.

## Full-body classification (non-negotiable)
1. Read the entire source body/transcript.
2. Place and tag from actual meaning — not filename, title keywords, or static enums alone.
3. Prefer known leaves in `_config/taxonomy.md` when they fit.
4. Otherwise extend the map per taxonomy extension protocol.


## Trigger Patterns
- User drops a folder path or says "ingest this folder"
- User has markdown files with attachments they want processed
- User says "process these files" or "add these to the brain"
- User references a folder with `.md` files and/or images/PDFs

## Execution Pattern

Use `completion()` from the eval kernel with `parallel()` for batch processing — subagents on smaller models fail at complex OKF extraction/writing tasks. Process in batches of 10.

```
# Correct pattern
results = parallel([lambda f=f: process_one(f) for f in batch])

# Wrong pattern — do NOT use task subagents for extraction or concept writing
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan the Folder
```
Read the directory tree
- Identify all .md files (primary content)
- Identify all attachments (images, PDFs, other docs)
- Read each .md file to understand its content type
- Skip duplicate files: numbered suffixes (" 1.md", " 2.md"), content duplicates
- Skip hub files (domain/subdomain hubs are structural, not source content)
```

### Step 2: Classify Each File (Full-Body Classification)

For each markdown file:

1. **Check existing frontmatter** — parse it if present
2. **Read the FULL body** of the file — do NOT rely on filename, keyword matching, or tag tables alone
3. **Based on the FULL content**, determine domain/subdomain/subsubdomain:

   | Domain | Content scope | Visibility default |
   |--------|--------------|-------------------|
   | `life` | personal topics, journaling, personal goals | private |
   | `learning` | Everything else: recipes, cooking, health, exercise, dev articles, languages, music | shareable |
   | `tools` | GitHub repos, apps, devices, software | shareable |
   | `skills` | AI-related content | shareable |
   | `specs` | AI-related specifications | shareable |
   | `people` | Private contacts | private |
   | `orgs` | Organizations | private |
   | `documents` | Identity/records | private |
   | `work` | Work logs, enterprise notes | private |
   | `creators` | Public content creators | shareable |

   **Personal domains** (`life`, `people`, `orgs`, `documents`, `work`) default to `visibility: private`. All other domains default to `shareable`. When unsure, treat as `private`.

4. **Subdomain routing** — match against `VALID_SUBDOMAINS`, not keyword tables:

   ```
   VALID_SUBDOMAINS = {
       "creators": ["general"], "documents": ["general"], "specs": ["general"], "orgs": ["general"],
       "people": ["medical", "tech", "general"], "skills": ["content", "general"],
       "work": ["sharepoint", "azure", "general"],
       "life": ["personal"],
       "tools": ["agents", "dev", "general"],
       "learning": ["dev", "languages", "music", "skills", "cooking", "health", "general"],
   VALID_SUBSUBS = {
       "learning": {"dev": ["javascript", "react", "css", "typescript", "vue", "svelte", "html", "git", "dotnet", "api", "performance", "ai", "architecture"],
                    "health": ["fitness", "nutrition"],
                    "skills": ["journaling"],
       "tools": {"agents": ["orchestration", "coding-agents", "sandboxes", "memory", "mcp", "general"],
                 "dev": ["general", "devices"],
                 "general": ["devices", "general", "orchestration"]},
   }
   ```

5. **Critical domain routing changes** (vs. legacy):
   - `cooking`, `health` → `learning/`, NOT `life/`
   - `life/` is personal topics only
   - `tools/health` → distributed: devices stay in `tools/dev/devices/`, apps/content go to `learning/health/`
   - `tools/dev/coding-agents` → `tools/agents/coding-agents`
   - `tools/dev/orchestration` → `tools/agents/orchestration`
6. **Derive slug** from title or filename: format `{owner}-{name}` lowercase with hyphens
7. **Check for existing concept** with that slug → skip or merge

### Step 2b: Tag Audit (During Ingest)

After reading the full body for classification, **review tags for each file**:

- Remove `youtube`, `clippings`, and domain-redundant tags (e.g., a `learning` tag on a concept already in `learning/`)
- Normalize all tags to **lowercase + hyphen** format
- **Add missing meaningful tags** derived from the full body content
- Normalize near-duplicates per tag conventions (singular preferred, consistent hyphenation)
- Ensure **at least one meaningful tag** per concept
- Remove garbage/hex/numeric-only tags
- Keep the `dev` tag (add specific sub-topic tags like `javascript`, `typescript`, `react` alongside when applicable)
- Avoid singular/plural duplicates — pick one form (singular preferred)

### Step 3: Pre-flight Ledger
Before writing any concept files, build and reconcile the full plan:
1. For every file, record: filename → slug → domain → action (CREATE/SKIP)
2. Check every intended slug against existing concepts (glob + `okf search`)
3. Check for same-prefix collisions (`owner-repo` vs `owner-repo-the-full-name`)
4. Reconcile totals — every file accounted for as CREATE or SKIP with reason
5. Only then start writing

### Step 4: Process Attachments
- Images referenced in markdown → note their paths
- If images need to be in the repo, copy to `raw/attachments/<slug>/` and rewrite paths
- PDFs → note as references in the concept body
- If the folder contains attachments not referenced by any .md, create a `note` concept listing them

### Step 5: Batch Create
For each file, run the standard OKF ingest pipeline via `completion()` + `parallel()`:
1. Create or update canonical concept at `concepts/<domain>/<subdomain>/<slug>.md` (or `concepts/<domain>/<subdomain>/<subsub>/<slug>.md` for subsubdomains, or `concepts/<domain>/<slug>.md` if no subdomain)
2. Write frontmatter: `type`, `visibility`, `title`, `description`, `domain`, `tags`
3. Write body preserving the original content structure
4. If external source, snapshot to `raw/`

### Step 6: Canonicalize (serial — the barrier)

**This is the critical step.** After ALL concepts are created, resolve conflicts before proceeding. Do NOT skip — this prevents duplicate pages with divergent content.

1. **Slug collision detection** — run `okf index` + `okf lint` and check for `duplicate` and `slug-collision` warnings. Also glob `concepts/<domain>/` and `concepts/<domain>/<subdomain>/` for same-prefix slugs.
2. **Resolve collisions** — for each pair:
   - Short slug is authoritative (correct frontmatter)
   - Old long-slug versions have outdated metadata (`type: note`, `visibility: private`, no tags)
   - Compare old vs new content: if old has unique substance not in new, merge it in first
   - Delete the old long-slug file, keep the short slug
3. **Tag normalization** — for all newly created concepts:
   - Tags are lowercase, hyphenated, singular (e.g., `self-hosting` not `Self-Hosting`)
   - Normalize plurals: agents→agent, skills→skill, tools→tool, orgs→org, hormones→hormone, languages→language, loops→loop, standards→standard, supplements→supplement, containers→container, coding-agents→coding-agent, agent-skills→agent-skill, surfaces→surface
   - **Reorg merge rules** (established during vault reorganization):
     - `ai-skills` → `ai`
     - `agenticcoding` → `agentic-engineering`
     - `blood-sugar` → `glucose`
     - `health-metric` → `health`
     - `api-keys` → `api`
     - `blood` → `blood-pressure`
     - `liver` → `liver-health`
     - `webassembly` → `wasm`
     - `cardio` → `cardiovascular`
     - `supplement` → `supplements`
     - `hormone-disruptor` → `endocrine-disruptor`
     - `ldl-cholesterol` → `ldl`
     - `hdl-cholesterol` → `hdl`
     - `insulin-resistance` → `metabolic-health`
     - `heart` → `cardiovascular`
     - `cholesterol` → `lipids`
     - `blood-pressure-medication` → `antihypertensive`
     - `testosterone-supplement` → `testosterone`
     - `omega3` → `omega-3`
     - `vitamin-d3` → `vitamin-d`
   - Remove domain-redundant tags (a `domain: tools` concept doesn't need a `tools` tag)
   - Remove the `clippings` tag (Obsidian clipping artifact, no meaning)
   - Remove the `youtube` tag (no meaningful information)
   - Remove domain-name tags (e.g., a concept in `learning/` doesn't need a `learning` tag)
   - Ensure at least one tag per concept
4. **Title/description check** — verify each new concept has a real title (not just the filename) and a one-line description
5. **Thin page detection** — flag concept pages with body < 100 chars. Re-generate thin pages with a tighter prompt, or merge into a parent concept if too insubstantial.

### Step 7: Normalize (content-specific)

Apply only where provenance indicates the source type:

- **YouTube/video transcripts** — ASR normalization: fix known auto-caption garbles (e.g., "Enthropic"→"Anthropic", "pantic AI"→"Pydantic AI", "Lang graph"→"LangGraph"). Fix ONLY proper nouns and technical terms. Preserve all other wording exactly.
- **GitHub READMEs** — normalize heading depth (ensure `##` as top body level, not `#`), strip raw HTML if markdown equivalent exists.
- **Article clippings** — remove boilerplate (cookie notices, signup CTAs, nav text) that may have been captured.

Do NOT apply transcript-specific ASR fixes to non-transcript content.

### Step 8: Cross-Link + Hub Update
- After all concepts are created and canonicalized, search for cross-links between them
- Use `okf search` to find related existing concepts
- Add bidirectional links where relevant — use bundle-relative paths:
  - `/concepts/<domain>/<slug>.md` for flat domain concepts
  - `/concepts/<domain>/<sub>/<slug>.md` for subdomain concepts
  - `/concepts/<domain>/<sub>/<subsub>/<slug>.md` for subsubdomain concepts
- Ensure `## Related` sections use typed subheadings with one-line descriptions rather than bare link lists
- **Depth-conditional backlinks** — every new concept MUST link back to its parent hub:
  - Subsubdomain concept → backlink to `concepts/<domain>/<sub>/<subsub>.md` (the subsubdomain hub)
  - Flat subdomain concept (no subsub) → backlink to `concepts/<domain>/<sub>.md` (the subdomain hub)
  - Flat domain concept (no subdomain) → backlink to `concepts/<domain>/<domain>.md` (the domain hub)
- **Update hub files** — for each new concept, add a link entry to the appropriate hub per the depth rules above

### Step 8b: Theme Reconciliation
After cross-linking, check whether newly created concepts belong to existing themes and update theme data:

1. Load existing theme structure (do NOT hardcode theme names — they evolve):
   - Read `tools/taxonomy.json` — top-level keys are theme names, values are slug arrays
   - Read `themes/index.md` — maps theme names to concept counts, domains spanned, and primary tags
2. Build a tag→theme lookup from the index table's "Primary Tags" column (or from the slugs already in each taxonomy entry: scan existing slugs, read their frontmatter tags, and group)
3. For each newly created concept, check if any of its tags overlap with a theme's characteristic tags:
   - If ≥2 tags match one theme → assign to that theme
   - If exactly 1 tag matches and no other theme fits → assign to that theme
   - If tags match multiple themes → assign to all matching themes
4. For each assignment, append the concept slug to the matching theme's array in `tools/taxonomy.json` — skip if already present, then dedupe+sort the array
5. If a cluster of 10+ new concepts shares tags that don't fit any existing theme, create a new theme key in `tools/taxonomy.json`
6. If 5+ new concepts land in one theme, update the corresponding `themes/<slug>.md` synthesis file:
   - Add new concepts to the relevant Knowledge Synthesis sub-section
   - Update the concept count in the Overview
   - Update `themes/index.md` concept count for that theme's row

### Step 9: Regenerate + Verify
```bash
python3 tools/okf.py index
python3 tools/okf.py lint
python3 tools/okf.py relink --dry-run
python3 tools/okf.py relink  # only if dry-run shows rewrites
```
Fix any new lint regressions introduced by this batch (broken links to newly created concepts, missing required frontmatter on new files, tag violations). Pre-existing warnings are non-blocking — `lint` is report-only and broken links are tolerated per project contract. Re-run `okf index` + `okf lint` after fixes.

### Step 10: Update Catalog
- Update `index.md` concept counts and domain breakdown — derive counts from `okf.py index` output (canonical `tools/index.json`), not from ad-hoc file counting
- Append a single `log.md` entry for the batch:
```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] batch-ingest | <folder description>
- <N> concepts created from <folder path>
- <list of concept IDs created>
- <slug collisions resolved>
- <cross-links added>
- <attachment handling notes>
- <verification results>
- Corpus: <old_count> → <new_count> concepts (+<net> net).
```

### Step 11: Cleanup
- **Only move inbox files to `inbox/processed/` if ≥1 concept was actually created** — this is the postcondition guardrail
- **Failed items** → move to `inbox/failed/` with a `reasons.log` explaining why each item failed (no concept created, parse failure, etc.)
- Delete skipped duplicate files from the folder
- **Purge stale processed files** — delete any file in `inbox/processed/` that has been sitting there for more than 7 days (mtime-based; `mv` preserves mtime, so it reflects time in the folder). This is a maintenance step to keep the archive lean and runs every batch:
  ```bash
  PURGED=$(find "$VAULT/inbox/processed" -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +7 -delete -print | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  echo "Purged $PURGED processed file(s) older than 7 days."
  ```
  Never purge `inbox/failed/`, `raw/`, or `concepts/` — only the `processed` subfolder.
- Re-run `okf index` + `okf lint` one final time to confirm no new regressions from this batch
- **Auto cross-link** — run `python3 tools/okf.py link --auto --max 50 --min-score 50 --quiet` after the final index to connect new concepts to existing vault knowledge. Skips already-linked pairs and noisy hubs.

## Tag Handling
- If user provides `#hashtags` with the folder request, apply them to ALL concepts in the batch
- If individual files have their own tags in frontmatter, merge with batch tags
- `#private` on the batch → all concepts `visibility: private`

## Duplicate Detection
- Before creating each concept, run `okf search "<title>"` to check if it exists
- If a concept with the same slug exists → update it (merge content, append new source)
- Never overwrite curated content — append only
- Numbered-suffix files (` 1.md`, ` 2.md`) are always duplicates of the unnumbered version — skip them
- Content duplicates (same tool/project described differently) — keep the better slug/metadata version

## Attachment Types
- `.md` → primary content
- `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.svg` → attachments, copy to `raw/attachments/`
- `.pdf` → reference, note path in concept body
- `.csv`, `.json` → data files, note path in concept body
- Other → note as reference, skip binary processing

| Aspect | okf-batch-ingest | okf-ingest-channel |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Scope | Folders of mixed markdown | Entire YouTube channel |
| Source types | GitHub READMEs, article clippings, notes, videos | YouTube transcripts only |
| Classification | Full-body classification (read entire body, not keywords) | Tag-based transcript routing |

## `ingest.py` Caveats

`tools/ingest.py` has known limitations requiring a **mandatory post-ingest cleanup pass**:

1. **Slug-from-path bug**: When `parse_source()` fails to extract a title, `slugify()` falls back to `source_ref` (file path), producing garbage slugs (`users-ima-okf-inbox-...`). Always verify and rename slugs post-ingest.
2. **No subdomain support**: `ingest.py` only accepts `--domain`. Subdomain routing must be done post-ingest via file moves.
3. **Title extraction may fail**: Obsidian clipping frontmatter produces mangled titles. Inspect all frontmatter after ingest.
4. **Post-ingest cleanup is mandatory**: Rename garbage slugs → move to correct subdomain/subsubdomain paths → fix frontmatter → delete true duplicates (check existing file quality for merge).
5. **Title extraction from headings**: Skip structural headings (`Transcript`, `Features`, `Installation`, `Readme`, `Overview`, `Introduction`) — not suitable concept titles.
