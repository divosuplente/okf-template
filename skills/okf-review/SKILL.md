description: "Spaced-repetition review engine for OKF learning concepts. Triggered when user says \"spaced repetition\", \"SRS session\", \"what's due for review\", \"review queue\", or \"recall practice\". Pulls concepts past their review interval, presents active recall exercises, and updates intervals based on recall scores. NOT for searching, querying, or general knowledge lookup — use okf-query for that."

# OKF Review Skill

## Trigger Patterns
- "review my learning"
- "spaced repetition"
- "recall session"
- "what should I review"
- "review session"
- "time to review"
- "/review"
- "/recall"

## Interval Schedule

The review engine tracks each concept's review interval via the `review_interval` frontmatter field (in days). The `timestamp` field records the last review date.

**Default progression:**

| Score | Action | Interval change |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| ✅ Full recall | Advance to next interval | 1d → 3d → 7d → 14d → 30d |
| 🟡 Partial | Halve current interval | e.g. 7d → 3d, 14d → 7d |
| ❌ Failed | Reset to 1d, re-study now | Any → 1d |

The interval ladder: **New → 1d → 3d → 7d → 14d → 30d**

- If ✅ and already at 30d, stay at 30d (maintenance mode).
- If 🟡 halves to a non-ladder value (e.g. 3d → 1.5d), round down to the nearest ladder step (→ 1d).

**Frontmatter fields used:**
```yaml
review_interval: 3        # current interval in days (absent = new, treat as 1d)
timestamp: 2026-08-10     # last review date (ISO 8601 date)
```

## SESSION Procedure

A timed retrieval-practice session. Goal: recall from memory, not re-read.

### 1. Find stale concepts

```bash
# Concepts due for review (timestamp older than their interval)
python3 tools/okf.py search "domain:learning" --limit 50
```

Then filter: a concept is **due** when `today - timestamp >= review_interval`. For concepts without `review_interval`, treat as new (interval = 1d, always due).

Priority order:
1. ❌-scored concepts from prior sessions (re-study)
2. Overdue concepts (most days past due first)
3. Newly added concepts (never reviewed)

### 2. Present title + description only

For each concept in the queue:

```
📚 Review #N of ~M

**[Concept Title]**
> One-line description from frontmatter

What are the key ideas? Explain from memory.
```

**Do NOT show the concept body.** This is retrieval practice — the struggle is the point.

### 3. User recalls and self-rates

Let the user answer (verbally or typed). Then:

```
Rate your recall:
  ✅ — Full recall, all key points present
  🟡 — Partial, core idea intact but details missed
  ❌ — Failed, couldn't recall the core idea
```

### 4. Show body for comparison

After the user rates, display the concept body:

```
--- Answer ---
[concept body content]
--------------
```

Note gaps: what was missed, what was wrong, what was vague. Keep it brief — one or two sentences.

### 5. Update interval and timestamp

Based on the rating, update the concept's frontmatter:

| Rating | `review_interval` | `timestamp` |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| ✅ | Advance one step on ladder | today |
| 🟡 | Halve (round down to ladder step) | today |
| ❌ | Reset to 1 | **don't update** (keeps it due tomorrow) |

For ❌, also prompt: "Re-study this concept now? (y/n)" — if yes, recommend using [okf-study](/skills/okf-study/SKILL.md) Step 1–4 on this concept.

### 6. Next concept

Move to the next concept in the priority queue. Repeat until timer expires.

## INTERVAL Procedure

Check what's due without starting a full session.

```bash
# List all learning concepts with their review status
python3 tools/okf.py search "domain:learning" --limit 200
```

For each concept, compute `days_overdue = (today - timestamp) - review_interval`.

Report:
- **Overdue** (days_overdue > 0): list with overdue count
- **Due today** (days_overdue = 0)
- **Upcoming** (due in next 3 days)
- **Not yet reviewed** (no `review_interval` field)

## STATS Procedure

Report review statistics for learning concepts.

```bash
python3 tools/okf.py search "domain:learning" --limit 500
```

Count and report:

| Bucket | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| Overdue | `today - timestamp > review_interval` |
| Due today | `today - timestamp = review_interval` |
| Learning | `review_interval` ≤ 3 |
| Consolidating | `review_interval` 7–14 |
| Maintained | `review_interval` ≥ 30 |
| New | no `review_interval` field |
| Dormant | `status: dormant` |

Display as a compact summary:

```
📊 Review Stats (N total concepts)
  🔴 Overdue: X    🟡 Due today: Y
  📗 Learning: A   📘 Consolidating: B   📕 Maintained: C
  ✨ New: D        💤 Dormant: E
```

## Session Timer

- Set a 15–20 minute timer at session start.
- When time is up, finish the current concept's rating, then stop.
- Report session summary:
  - Concepts reviewed (with scores)
  - Concepts still in queue
  - Suggested next session time (based on soonest overdue concept)

## Integration with okf-study

The [okf-study](/skills/okf-study/SKILL.md) skill Step 5 (Schedule Review) uses this skill's interval ladder and `review_interval`/`timestamp` fields:

- After a study session's recall step, **update `review_interval` and `timestamp`** per the ladder table in Step 5.
- A study session may include a mini-review of stale concepts before starting new material: run SESSION procedure for 5 minutes, then proceed with study.
